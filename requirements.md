🔻Vertical Dropdown's:​
✍️ Functionality - 🙏🏼 Request ✅1 - 6, Apparently:
Vertical Menu Panel:
Must not include a search bar – this is intentional.
Request:
✅1 Multi-Selection:
Multi-Select
Some Real Estate Agent's will check at register that they are ​also real estate attorney's, escrow business owner, appraiser,  mortgage broker's, list could go on.
✅2 Indentation's:
Categories Indented.
Display all categories, sub-categories, and niches in one scrollable list​​
✅3 Full Category (Inside Each Dropdown):
Each space in following refeerence un-derlined page is ah category see page each space represent's seperate category.
💼 Agent 
💼Real Estate Agent 
🏚️ Vacancy 
Vacant 
Tenant Occupied ​
🛠️ Property Condition 
New Construction ​
Burned 
🏣 Field's
Commercial ​
Agricultural. 
✅4 Dynamic Drop-down Flow:
Use hierarchical dropdowns that dynamically update based on user selections:
User selects from 1st dropdown → triggers new options in 2nd, so forth. 
Example:
"Service Type" → "Mortgage Consultant"
Then triggers → "Loan Type" → "Over 740+ Credit Score Consultant's"
Then → "Length; (Year's): 30, 15, 10, 5 " 
Each dropdown becomes more specific based on the previous selection.
​​​
✅5 PSP's that have different Filter's: 
Click Here; See all of them One Page.
Professional's:
Office people; for now, will share same filter's except ​
Mortgage Consultant's we will evolve and define filter's later for other professional's, so far this is what we have.
Trade.
Difference here is that they inform public of pr. sq. ft.​​
​​
✅6 Preferrably Same tab Window, But New Tab Window is fine:
When change psp for filter's to tailor to the psp exchange. 
We try and avoid confusion by openning alot of tab window's how fiverr does, however some way they make sure that that catgegory is also more niched or and that is also our ultimate goal so perhap's.
To even each PSP them out equally.
​​
🚨 NON-NEGOTIABLE: REFERRAL, HOME PAGE, LANDING PAGE; HERO SECTION DROPDOWNS MUST BE IMPLEMENTED
If we didn't experience limitations with Wix — where dropdown filters had been embedded in hero section — would not justify issue happening in Bubble. Also; Bubble offers significantly more layout and conditional logic flexibility than Wix.
​
✅ Instruction to Developer: If for any reason you cannot fit the dropdown filters directly into the HERO section, that’s not a blocker — you must still implement them one way or another. Bubble allows for:
Floating groups
Modals
Custom layout containers
Overlapping elements
Conditional visibility
Slide-ins / Drawers
​
We chose Bubble so we don’t face those same platform limitations.
💬 Developer Note:
Bubble is designed for this level of logic. If it wasn't a problem at Wix AI Say's — it should be doable at bubble.io here. Not fitting is not valid reason for filters to be excluded from Hero experience.

AI TRANSLATION ASSISTANCE: 
1. User Journey (you already got this 🧠)
Make sure you’ve mapped:
Entry point (how they arrive)


First “aha” moment


Core loop (what brings them back)


Exit points (log out, cancel, share, upgrade)


If you can’t draw it on one page → it’s not ready.

2. User Personas (who is walking the journey)
Not just “users” — specific humans:
New / returning


Free / paid


Builder / consumer / admin


Skeptical vs motivated users


Every screen should silently answer:
 “Who is this for?”

3. Value Proposition per Screen
Every page must answer one question clearly:
“Why should I care right now?”
If a screen doesn’t:
Reduce friction


Increase clarity


Create trust


Move the user forward


…it’s dead weight.

4. Onboarding & First 5 Minutes
Most apps die here.
Checklist:
Do users know what to do in 10 seconds?


Is there a guided action (not just text)?


Can they succeed without reading docs?


🔥 Rule: Show → Let them do → Reward immediately

5. Permissions & Trust Moments
Before asking for:
Email


Payment


Data access


Personal info


You must answer:
Why now?


What do they get?


What do they NOT lose?


Trust is a feature, not legal boilerplate.

6. Empty States (HUGELY skipped)
What happens when:
No data yet


No projects


No messages


No results


Empty ≠ blank.
 Empty should teach, guide, or motivate.

7. Error States & Edge Cases
Ask:
What if they mess up?


What if the API fails?


What if they abandon halfway?


What if they do things out of order?


Good apps feel forgiving, not brittle.

8. Roles & Permissions
Be explicit:
Who can see what?


Who can edit?


Who can break things?


If this isn’t defined early, it becomes a nightmare later.

9. Data Lifecycle (this is architecture-level important)
For each major object:
Where is it created?


How is it updated?


When is it archived?


Can it be deleted?


Who owns it?


This prevents future chaos.

10. Feedback Loops
How does the app respond when users:
Complete something


Fail something


Make progress


Go inactive


Examples:
Progress indicators


Notifications


Subtle rewards


“You’re X% done” signals


People need signals of movement.

11. Metrics (what success looks like)
At minimum define:
Activation metric


Engagement metric


Retention metric


Conversion metric


If you don’t define these, you’re flying blind.

12. Exit & Recovery Paths (almost nobody plans this)
Cancel subscription


Delete account


Export data


Re-activate later


Ironically, easy exits increase trust and retention.

13. Future-Proofing (without overbuilding)
Ask:
What will we add later?


What must NOT break?


What should be modular?


Plan interfaces, not features.

Mental Model to Remember
If User Journey is the road, then:
Personas = drivers


Value = fuel


Trust = seatbelts


Data = engine


Feedback = dashboard


Metrics = GPS


Skip any one → breakdowns happen later.

If you want, next we can:
Turn this into a 1-page app readiness checklist


Apply it directly to your current platform


Or map Phase 1 → Phase 5 against this so nothing ships half-baked


Just tell me where you want to zoom in 👊
